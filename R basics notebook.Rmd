This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

R Data Types
numeric - floats and ints
logicals - booleans
characters - strings

Vector basics
- You can't mix data types in vectors. R will convert data types if you try to.


```{r}
nvec <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
temps <- c(72,71,68,73,69,75,76)
names(temps) <- c('Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun')

```

Vector operations
There are some built in functions: sum, etc.

```{r}
v1 <- c(1,2,3)
v2 <- c(5,6,7)
v1 + v2
sum(v1)
mean(v1)
sd(v1)
max(v1)
min(v1)
prod(v1)

```
Comparison operators
```{r}
5 > 6
5 < 6
5 <= 6
2 == 3
#careful with spacing var < -2 versus var <- 2
v1 > v2
```
Vector indexing and slicing

```{r}
v1 <- c(100,200,300)
v2 <- c('a','b','c')
v1[1]
v2[c(1,3)]
v3 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
v3[2:4] #slicing

```

stock.prices <- c(23,27,23,21,34)
names(stock.prices) <- c('Mon','Tues','Wed','Thu','Fri')

mean(stock.prices)
over.23 <- stock.prices > 23
stock.prices[over.23]
max(stock.prices)
```
